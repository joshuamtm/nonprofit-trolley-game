                    explanation: "QA in AI requires ensuring the quality and reliability of AI systems, which is particularly challenging due to probabilistic responses. Unlike traditional software, AI systems don't always produce the same output for the same input, requiring a shift to 'always-on' production quality monitoring rather than just pre-launch testing."

                    explanation: "AI creates a fundamental shift where execution becomes cheaper and faster, but this leads to higher expectations for output quality and speed. Rather than eliminating jobs entirely, this reshapes roles - some execution-focused aspects may be automated while creating new needs for oversight, quality control, relationship management, and strategic thinking."
